# GitHub Copilot Instructions for E-commerce Workshop

## Project Context

This is a Next.js e-commerce application built with modern web technologies. The project focuses on best practices for AI-assisted development and comprehensive testing strategies.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: [Your database choice - PostgreSQL/MongoDB/etc.]
- **Testing**: Playwright (E2E), Jest (Unit), React Testing Library
- **State Management**: React Context + useReducer
- **Package Manager**: npm

## Code Style and Patterns

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Follow the single responsibility principle

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use strict typing - avoid `any`
- Create interfaces for all data structures
- Use generics for reusable components
- Implement proper error handling with typed errors

### Styling Conventions

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Maintain consistent spacing and colors
- Use CSS modules for complex styling only

### API and Data Handling

- Use async/await for promises
- Implement proper error handling
- Validate all inputs with schemas
- Use TypeScript for API response types

## E-commerce Specific Patterns

### Product Management

- Products have: id, name, price, inventory, category, images
- Implement inventory checking before purchases
- Support product variants (size, color, etc.)

### Shopping Cart

- Persist cart state across sessions
- Handle quantity updates and item removal
- Calculate totals with tax and shipping
- Implement cart abandonment recovery

### User Authentication

- Support email/password and social login
- Implement proper session management
- Handle password reset flows
- Protect sensitive user data

### Payment Processing

- Integrate with payment providers securely
- Handle payment failures gracefully
- Implement order confirmation flows
- Support multiple payment methods

## Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Test component logic and state management
- Mock external dependencies
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Maintain high code coverage for business logic

### Integration Tests

- Test API endpoints with real database
- Test component interactions
- Validate data flow between layers
- Test third-party integrations

### E2E Tests

- Cover critical user journeys
- Test checkout and payment flows
- Validate responsive design
- Test accessibility requirements

## Accessibility Requirements

- Implement semantic HTML structure
- Provide proper ARIA labels
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Maintain color contrast ratios
- Support screen readers

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize images and assets
- Implement lazy loading where appropriate
- Use Next.js performance optimizations
- Monitor and optimize bundle size

## Security Best Practices

- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Implement CSRF protection
- Use HTTPS in production
- Secure API endpoints with proper authentication
- Follow OWASP guidelines for web applications

## Documentation Standards

- Write clear, concise comments
- Document complex business logic
- Maintain up-to-date README files
- Document API endpoints with examples

## Helpful Context for Code Generation

When generating code, consider:

- The e-commerce domain and business rules
- User experience and conversion optimization
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Performance and accessibility
- Comprehensive error handling
- Scalability and maintainability

## Common Patterns to Follow

- Use custom hooks for shared logic
- Implement loading and error states
- Create reusable UI components
- Follow REST API conventions
- Use environment variables for configuration
