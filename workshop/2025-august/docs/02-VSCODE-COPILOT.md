### How to Use Copilot for Each Common Issue

#### Issue 1: Rollup Native Module Error

When you encounter this error during `npm install` or `npm run dev`:

```bash
Error: Cannot find module @rollup/rollup-darwin-arm64. npm has a bug related to
optional dependencies (https://github.com/npm/cli/issues/4828). Please try npm i
again after removing both package-lock.json and node_modules directory.
```

**Use Copilot to solve it:**

1. **Copy the complete error message** (including all stack traces)
2. **Open Copilot Chat** and enable **Agent mode**
3. **Ask Copilot:**
   ```
   Fix this error:
   [paste your complete error message here]
   ```
4. **Let Copilot analyze** and suggest the solution (it will likely recommend cleaning dependencies)
5. **Follow Copilot's commands** exactly as suggested
6. **Ask follow-up questions** if the fix doesn't work: "The error persists, what else should I try?"

#### Issue 2: Module Import/Export Errors

When browser console shows errors like:

```text
Header.tsx:7 Uncaught SyntaxError: The requested module '/node_modules/.vite/deps/@phosphor-icons_react.js?v=0aeb0506' does not provide an export named 'LogOut'
```

**Use Copilot to solve it:**

1. **Copy the browser console error**
2. **In Copilot Chat, ask:**

   ```
   There's a console error with this icon import:
   [paste your error here]

   Please fix the import and show me the correct icon name to use.
   ```

3. **Let Copilot identify** the correct Phosphor icon names
4. **Ask Copilot to make the changes** for you, or follow its suggested replacements
5. **Verify the fix** by refreshing the browser

#### Issue 3: Port Already in Use

When you see:

```bash
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::5173
```

**Use Copilot to solve it:**

1. **Copy the port conflict error**
2. **Ask Copilot:**

   ```
   This port is already in use:
   [paste your error]

   Please help me either kill the process or use a different port.
   ```

3. **Let Copilot provide the terminal commands** to resolve the conflict
4. **Execute the commands** Copilot suggests
5. **Ask for alternatives** if needed: "What if I want to use a different port instead?"

### Key Copilot Troubleshooting Principles

1. **Always use Agent mode** - This lets Copilot execute commands and edit files
2. **Paste complete error messages** - Never truncate or summarize errors
3. **Ask for explanations** - "Why did this happen?" helps you learn
4. **Request step-by-step solutions** - "Walk me through fixing this"
5. **Let Copilot do the work** - Don't try to solve it yourself first
6. **Verify each step** - Ask "Did that work?" before moving to the next step

### Sample Copilot Prompts for Troubleshooting

```
"Fix this npm error: [paste error]"

"This React component has an import error: [paste error] - please fix the imports"

"The dev server won't start: [paste error] - help me resolve this"

"I'm getting a TypeScript error: [paste error] - what's wrong and how do I fix it?"

"This dependency seems to be missing: [paste error] - please install and configure it"
```

## Part 4: Essential GitHub Copilot Features

### 1. Code Completion

Copilot provides intelligent code suggestions as you type:

```typescript
// Type a comment to guide Copilot
// Create a function to calculate cart total with tax and shipping

// Copilot will suggest:
function calculateCartTotal(
  items: CartItem[],
  taxRate: number,
  shipping: number
): number {
  const subtotal = items.reduce(
    (sum, item) => sum + item.price * item.quantity,
    0
  );
  const tax = subtotal * taxRate;
  return subtotal + tax + shipping;
}
```

### 2. Copilot Chat

Use Copilot Chat for complex questions and refactoring:

```bash
# Open Copilot Chat (Ctrl+Shift+I / Cmd+Shift+I)
# Ask questions like:
"How can I implement error handling for this API call?"
"Refactor this component to use TypeScript generics"
"Write unit tests for this shopping cart function"
```

### 3. Inline Chat

Quick questions and modifications:

```typescript
// Select code and press Ctrl+I / Cmd+I
// Ask: "Add proper error handling to this function"
// Ask: "Make this component responsive with Tailwind"
```

### 4. Code Explanations

```bash
# Select code and ask:
"/explain this React component"
"/explain the purpose of this hook"
```

### 5. Generate Documentation

```typescript
// Select a function and ask:
"/doc add JSDoc comments to this function";
```

## Part 5: Creating and Configuring .copilot-instructions.md
